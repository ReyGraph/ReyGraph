## 🛠️ Philosophy & Approach
- All systems are designed to **scale quickly** without sacrificing simplicity.  
- I avoid over-engineering; every module serves a measurable purpose.  
- Build only if it doesn’t exist; validate before coding.  
- Experiments > theory — mistakes are lessons.

## 🛟 Projects
**Ravolin** → Developer community + startup building **web apps, software, games, and systems**.  
**Hushby® Pods** → World's first **floating couple capsules** for rivers & backwaters, stargazing, candlelight, escapes.  

> Both in active development. Systems are **modular, scalable, and playful**.
